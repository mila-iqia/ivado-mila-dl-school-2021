In such a setting, we need to use padding but we also use another technique called \"masking\". Masking is a way to make a model (and the training process in general) ignore some of the elements in the inputs.\n",

        "The pre-trained T5-small model, without any fine-tuning, was able to generate very good translations of highly domain-specific text data. In many scenarios, the translations generated by this model, though inexact, could have been used as-is.\n",
        "\n",
        "In an effort to improve the results on our new dataset, we used part of the data to fine-tune the model which improved the results even more. Keep in mind, also, that we have severely limited the fine-tuning out of concern for execution time.\n",
        "- We used only 9000 training sentences out of the millions of sentences that the dataset contains.\n",
        "- We limited training time to a single epoch instead of training as long as the validation performance was improving.\n",
        "- We used the default hyper-parameters (learning rate, etc.) and made no attempt to tune them.\n",
        "\n",
        "This highlights the fact that fine-tuning could likely have improved performance a lot more if we had devoted more resources to it. Nonetheless, we were able to improve model performance quite a bit, proving that fine-tuning can be very useful even when very little data is available."
